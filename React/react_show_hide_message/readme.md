# React Conditional Rendering Example

## Overview

This project is a React application that demonstrates conditional renderingâ€”a core concept in React allowing components to render different elements or content based on certain conditions. This application toggles between showing an educational message about how React works and hiding it.

## Detailed Descriptions

### Component: InfoToggle
**Functionality**: This component is a button that toggles between showing an educational message explaining conditional rendering and showing a blank state.
**Parameters**: None. This component manages its own internal state without props.

## Usage Instructions

To experience the conditional rendering in action, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a modern web browser that supports JavaScript ES6 (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Edge).
2. Download or clone the repository containing the project files.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to interact with the application.

## Installation Guide

No formal installation is necessary. The project runs in any modern browser, thanks to the use of CDN-hosted React and ReactDOM libraries. Just ensure that the `index.js` file is in the same directory as your `index.html`.

## How It Works

The button within the `InfoToggle` component controls the display of the educational message. When clicked, it toggles the state of the component, triggering a re-render. The render method checks the state and decides whether to show the message or render a blank page.
