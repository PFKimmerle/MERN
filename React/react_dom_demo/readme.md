# First React Project

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of React to dynamically render an HTML page.

## Overview

This project illustrates the power of React to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) without refreshing the page. It showcases how React can manipulate the DOM using `ReactDOM.createRoot` and `root.render()`.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- React 18

## Setup

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. The React library is loaded from a CDN, so ensure you have an active internet connection.

## Features

- **Basic React DOM Rendering**: Demonstrates how to use React to dynamically update the content of a web page.
- **Use of CDN for React Libraries**: Utilizes external CDN links for React and ReactDOM libraries, simplifying the setup and reducing local project size.
- **React 18 Root API**: Employs the new `createRoot` API from React 18, enhancing application performance and enabling advanced React features like concurrent mode.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML and React script to render a greeting message.
- `README.md`: Provides information about the project and instructions for setup.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding how to set up a basic React environment using CDN links
- Familiarity with `ReactDOM.createRoot` and `root.render()` methods introduced in React 18
- Basic usage of `React.createElement` to manage content dynamically


## Note on React Version

This project was developed using React 18, which was the latest version at the time of this project's creation. Future versions of React may introduce changes that could affect how this code runs. It is advisable to check the current React documentation and update the dependencies as needed to ensure compatibility with newer versions.
