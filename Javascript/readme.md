# MERN - JavaScript Examples

This repository contains JavaScript examples demonstrating various features, including destructuring and DOM manipulation in a simple interactive webpage.

## Destructuring Examples

### Overview
These examples illustrate how to efficiently extract data from arrays and objects using JavaScript destructuring. Each example highlights a different aspect of destructuring, including variable renaming and dealing with nested structures.

### Problems
- **Problem 1**: Demonstrates basic array destructuring.
- **Problem 2**: Shows how to rename variables during object destructuring.
- **Problem 3**: What happens when trying to destructure a non-existent property.
- **Problem 4**: How to skip elements in array destructuring.
- **Problem 5**: Working with nested object destructuring.

### Learning Outcomes
Understanding how destructuring can simplify the process of accessing data and assigning it to variables, useful in handling complex data structures and API responses.

## Interactive Webpage Features

### My Boring Website
This project is a simple interactive webpage that uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM.

### Features
- **Change Background Color**: Clicking a button changes the background color of a paragraph.
- **Alert Popup**: A button that grabs the text from an input field and shows it in an alert popup.
- **Hover Effect**: Hovering over specific text changes the background color of the body.
- **Interactive Background Color**: Clicking a paragraph allows changing its background color based on the user's input in an adjacent field.
- **Reset Functionality**: A reset button that restores the original background colors.

### Setup
To view this webpage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

### Usage
- Click "this button" to change the color of the paragraph to a light blue.
- Enter text into the input field and click the "alert" button to display the text in an alert box.
- Hover over the word "this" to change the background color of the entire page to a soft red.
- Type a color into the input next to the last paragraph and click the paragraph to change its background color.
