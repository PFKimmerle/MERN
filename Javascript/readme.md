# MERN - JavaScript Examples

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript projects that demonstrate various features and concepts in the JavaScript programming language. Each project is designed to highlight different techniques and functionalities, from basic syntax to more complex features like object-oriented programming and asynchronous execution.

## Projects Overview

### Destructuring Examples

These examples demonstrate how to efficiently extract data from arrays and objects using JavaScript destructuring. They cover a range of techniques, from basic array destructuring to working with nested object structures.

### Interactive Webpage - My Boring Website

This simple interactive webpage utilizes JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, featuring various interactions such as changing background colors, creating alert popups, and more.

### Virtual Garden Game

An object-oriented programming project where players can manage a virtual garden, showcasing JavaScript classes, methods, and attributes.

### Coin Flip Simulation

A new addition to the repository, this project simulates the flipping of a coin using JavaScript's `Math.random()` function and demonstrates asynchronous programming with Promises.

## Detailed Descriptions

### Coin Flip Simulation

- **tossCoin Function**: Simulates a coin toss, randomly returning "heads" or "tails".
- **fiveHeads Function**: Uses Promises to toss coins until five consecutive "heads" are achieved, or stops if it exceeds 100 tosses without achieving this.

## Setup and Usage

Each project contains its own set of files. Clone the repository and navigate to the project's folder. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to interact with the projects, or follow specific instructions in the project's README.

## Learning Outcomes

These projects aim to teach various aspects of JavaScript, such as:

- Destructuring syntax and its applications.
- DOM manipulation and event handling.
- The use of JavaScript for simple simulations and games.
- Asynchronous programming with Promises.
